# PROJECT NAME

## Description

_Duration: 2 Days_

Directly above this is how long it took you to develop the project. Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it? 

This application prompts a user to add employee information to a table that will then calculate the monthly cost of the employees based on their annual salaries. If the total monthly cost exceeds $20,000, the monthly cost will highlight in red. The application also allows a user to remove specific employees to reach a desired monthly cost. 

At first, my approach was to loop through added employee info, calculating monthly cost. However, I then realized that the same goal could be acheived without loops. This helped simplify my code and remove some potential bugs.
